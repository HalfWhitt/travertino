The mechanisms for assigning styles and applicators to nodes, and applying styles, have been reworked. A node will now attempt to apply its style as soon as it is assigned an applicator; this means you should not assign an applicator to a node until the node is sufficiently initialized to apply its style. To accomodate uses that currently do not follow this order, any exceptions resulting from a failed style application are caught, and a runtime warning is issued. In a future version, this will be an exception. Assigning a new style will also trigger a reapply, as long as the applicator is already present.
