The mechanisms for assigning styles and applicators to nodes, and applying styles, has been reworked. A node will now attempt to apply its style as soon as it has both a style and an applicator assigned to it; this means you should wait to assign one or both until a node is sufficiently initialized to apply its style. To accomodate uses that currently do not follow this order, any exceptions resulting from a failed style application are caught, and a runtime warning is issued. In a future version, this will be an exception.
